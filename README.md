[CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) turns a stepper motor controlled rotary table into a CNC controlled device. It makes it easy to accurately set the position, rotate an index step back and forth, move between two positions or run at a constant speed. An automated lock signal can lock the rotary table when it is not moving. Place the rotary table on the cross slide of a lathe and you can change tools by pressing a button.  
[CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) is optimized to run on a small 7" touch screen. The supported controller is GRBL version 1.1 (or compatible grblHAL, grbl_ESP32), a free open source controller based on affordable Arduino hardware. The controller can be connected by USB, Bluetooth or a (wireless) network. If you ever wanted to CNC your rotary table, this is the easy and affordable way to do it.  
[CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) is also provided as a 30 days trial version. The trial version is a full version without limitations. Check the License Information task for more information. [CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) is available from the Microsoft Store.
