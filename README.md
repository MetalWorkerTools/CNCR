[CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) turns a stepper motor controlled rotary table into a CNC controlled device. It makes it easy to accurately set the position, rotate an index step back and forth, move between two positions or run at a constant speed. An automated lock signal can lock the rotary table when it is not moving. Place the rotary table on the cross slide of a lathe and you can change tools by pressing a button.  
[CNCR](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N7HPG47XK0G) is optimized to run on a small 7" touch screen.  
The supported controllers are [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki), [GRBL-L](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/grbl-L), [GRBL-L-Mega](https://github.com/MetalWorkerTools/grbl-L-Mega), [grblHAL](https://github.com/terjeio/grblHAL/wiki), [Grbl_ESP32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/wiki), or compatibles, free open source controllers based on affordable (Arduino) hardware. Check the hardware compatibility list for more information. The controller can be connected by USB, Bluetooth or a (wireless) network.  
If you ever wanted to CNC your rotary table, this is the easy and affordable way to do it.
